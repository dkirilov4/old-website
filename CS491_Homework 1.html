        The concept of wearing a pair of glasses or contact lenses in the future which translate any written text to us in the future is rather awe inspiring. To be able to think of such devices as something that will be readily available for the public in the near future shows the phenomenal progress we’ve made in technology over the years. There are many benefits to having access to such technology and many people would truly benefit from it in a good way. On the opposite spectrum, there are also some limitations and risks associated with using such a device.
Being able to readily understand any written text we see can be beneficial to everybody. For example, travelling to a foreign country would become many times easier. We would be able to find our way around without having the need for a translator or a slow dictionary. This could also remove the language barrier between countries in a way. Depending on how good the text recognition is, people could write out by hand or in their mobile device what they want to say and just show it to another person wearing the augmented reality glasses – people would be able to freely communicate to an extent.
Although there are numerous benefits to using such technology, it does have limitations and risks. One limitation is that many languages have phrases and jokes that only make sense when said in their language and in a particular way. Having such a phrase in a text written form and reading the translated version of that text would lose the meaning and the reader might misinterpret a joke as something serious for instance. Another limitation is the many human dialects and slang that people use which aren’t considered words but still convey meaning. New slang arises constantly – especially with the internet being so popular – thus it would be hard for a system to be able to translate everything. Apart from limitations, there are also risks involved with it. There is a possibility of the system being hackable and altering what people can read on text. This could lead to hazardous situations when dealing with important documents and the users are relying only on the tech to convey meaning. Another risk is that people who work with translating text will likely lose their jobs or at least income if the public starts using such tech.
Regarding the issue of control, I think the user should have enough control so that they change the displayed text’s font, color, and size. If some font is easier for a user to read I think they should have that option. I also think there should be options to highlight specific words so that they are more noticeable if they are in the text the user sees. This could be really beneficial if a user is looking for information about a specific matter in a multiple page paper that’s in a different language and they want to look for a specific word in that paper (sort of like a CTRL+F).
